I enjoy learning about brains, data analyses, and coding (stemmed from the satisfaction derived from solving problems). When I am not doing those, you will find me playing the piano, guitar, or harmonica. Recently I came across paper cutting and started doing those too! </small><br>

<small>
I have another <a href="https://yuanjourney.weebly.com/">blog </a>with casual topics and photography journals. 
</small><br>

<small>
Right now, I am focusing on my learning curve in the field of computer science and software development. <br>
In the future, I hope to improve understanding within the intersection of <b>computer science</b>, <b>psychology</b>, and <b>neuroscience</b>. </small>

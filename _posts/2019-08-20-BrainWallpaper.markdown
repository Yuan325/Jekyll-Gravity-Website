Know your brain in just one wallpaper!

When I first started my position in the Department of Psychiatry that involves working with brain, I made this little wallpaper to constantly remind myself of the parts of the brain. 

p/s: My background was in Psychology and I had not taken any neuroscience classes. _so yeap..._

These individual images were downloaded from google. My contribution was to merge them in photoshop! 

_A little brain wikipedia that I can easily refer to while working._

This is definitely one of the wallpapers that I looked at the most!
